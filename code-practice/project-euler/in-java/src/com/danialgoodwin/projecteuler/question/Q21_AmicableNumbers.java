/** Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
 If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

 For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

 Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

    // Ideas:
    // - 1. Could brute force by checking all numbers from lower to higher and the number is points to
    //   - To optimize, could remember the sum for all the numbers that have been checked already.
    //   - Better optimization would be a boolean array so that each number is checked a max of one time.
    // - 2. Could calculate the amicable numbers starting from divisors themselves, there could be a
    //       system of equations to use. At first it could be brute forcing all the possible factor
    //       between lowBound and highBound, but could find some optimizations with even/odd, maybe
    //       more. Multiplying numbers should be faster than factorization, though we would also be
    //       considering more numbers this way.
    // For initial productivity/prototyping, seems quicker to just do the first, especially because
