## Ideas
Specific:
- 'One survey' app. Give people the easy ability to set up surveys and share outcomes from it.
    - Users, by default, have the ability to share their own metrics/charts on the site, and other users can upvote/comment on them
    - Section for 'Future question ideas' (add/remove)
    - Ability to have a default set of optional demographics questions (age, country, education level)
    - At the end of the survey, show options for 'Take another survey' and 'See results from another survey'
    - Ability for other people/comanies to share their data/results with others
    - Should reach out to other big comanies
    - Can mark certain fields private
    - Should email be required to help prevent dulicate responces? Maybe just optional, and filter out?
        - Provides ability for users to get notified when survey is closed, chart available, data available
    - Feedback option goes to only main sponor or both gold and silver levels?
    - Ability to export as CSV (copyright includes attribution)
    - Ability to set length of survey being open
    - Dedicated status page for APIs to watch?
    - Benefits compared to others:
         - Not bias
         - Less duplicate surveys
         - No personal data is tracked. Hmmm, maybe no ads for anybody?
    - Monetization:
        - In the free version, survey and data is public, and ads are shown
        - Can 'sponsor' survey, multiple levels (1 main/gold? 5 silver? no bronze?), this could be an auction placement
        - Can pay to remove ads, remove public/all comments
        - Can pay to hide survey and data
        - Can pay for white-labeling

In general:
- Find a new way for people to express themselves, then build services around it
- Use theme of at least one of the seven sins
- Combine two or more fields to make an entirely new one
- How to show information/knowledge more clearly?

### For learning
Potentially create just 'minimal' versions of the following ideas, or enough to publish as an open-source library.

- '10,000': Track hours until mastery
- Explore government data, maybe just pick one to show nicely

- Chat (link via person/people, link via url)
- Dog walker with real-time tracking
- Marketplace
- Restaurant management
- Shopping list
- Website (Blogger, Reddit, Stack Overflow, User Voice)
    - Text-only version of sites
    - What's the best way to use the screen space for various sizes?
- Create a software GUI using voice commands (https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-09-20-10-crazy-cool-project-ideas-for-python-developers/)
- Picsong: Convert any image into audio



## Random Thoughts
- What's the minimal code needed to create a TODO app? Can I just only import libraries? Maybe theme libraries called material-red or material-0fffe5 for programmatic imports. Look at bootstrap components for ideas. Ability to mix and match UI layout and theme style and animation
    - Maybe a library called 'save and put to list' or 'save input to database'
    - Maybe a library called 'show input from database'
    - Maybe each view object should have a save-key or storage key. Inputs are automatically setters, and outputs are automatically getters. (this looks like 'data-binding')
- What is the simplest way to recreate websites for local restaurants? Many of them have a very similar format
- OS is an IDE
    - OS could already be thought of as a 'Do Everything IDE'.. everything just has bad integration and different themes
- Everything can be disrupted
