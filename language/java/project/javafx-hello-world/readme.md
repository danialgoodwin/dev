# JavaFX Hello World #

This is a simple project just to get started with making a GUI with JavaFX. The full app includes a button. When that button is clicked, a popup will appear with that text of the clicked button.

Everything is currently contained to a single class: `com/danialgoodwin/javafx/helloworld/Main.java`.
