What if we use `task` as the syntax for functions? (As opposed to 'def', define', 'fun', 'func', 'function')

    task doSomething():
        // ...

What if the language were called something like 'Real Life' language? Could parameters be passed in as `#` tags?

    task save #user
        // ...
    
    task doSomething #user #fast #5times
        save #user
        // ...
