Idea: Website where people can 'create' the programming language they want by just checking some boxes, like 'Strictly typed?', 'Purely Functional?', 'Include braces?'.
- Some choices would be hard trade-offs
- Depending on the choices, say which language has just been 'created'

To do this, we need a 'database' with descriptions/features for many different languages. And, perhaps the questions can be automatically generated based on the most languages that could be filtered.
- As people are going through the questions, there can be a list on the side for all the languages that match

Basic, 
C, strongly-typed, 
C++, strongly-typed, 
Cobalt, 
D, 
Excel, 
Fortran, 
Java, strongly-typed, 
JavaScript, dynamic
Kotlin, strongly-typed
Lisp, 
Perl, 
Prolog, 
Python, dynamic
R, 
Smalltalk, 
SQL, 

features:
- dynamic vs strongly-typed
- semicolon vs no semicolon
- braces vs no braces (aka whitespace)
