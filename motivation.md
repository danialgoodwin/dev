# Motivation for Developers (and more)

My TODO list always seems to be growing. So, new idea: For each TODO, estimate the time for completion and immediately do ones that take less than 5 minutes.


- 1% better every day
- When thinking 'I don't really want to do that', then just do it
- Maybe create a productivity journal. Get at least one high level task done each day



## Agility
1. Find out where you are
2. Take a small step towards your goal
3. Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
4. Repeat

Tip: When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier



## Opportunity Cost
By reading these words, you are choosing not to read something else. Everything we do is like this. Doing one thing requires giving up another. Whenever you explicitly choose to do one thing, you implicitly choose not to do another thing.



## Mottos
Have a personal motto for various things to ensure you have the right mindset.

- Are you moving one step in 20 directions or 20 steps in one direction?
- Progress, not perfection.
- A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
- It’s not about having time, it’s about making time.
- How we spend our days is how we spend our lives
- Knowledge means knowing where it’s written down.
- Sometimes our tools do what we tell them to. Other times, we adapt ourselves to our tools’ requirements.
- We shape our tools and, thereafter, our tools shape us.
- The only way to protect a good idea is superior execution.
- Any sufficiently advanced software is indistinguishable from magic.
- One of the hardest decisions you’ll ever face in life is choosing whether to walk away or try harder.
- Success is a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day.

- Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.
- Chance favors the prepared mind.
- The best time to plant a tree was 50 years ago. The second best time is today.
